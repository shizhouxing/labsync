# LabSync

This is a toolkit for development on university lab servers. 
The major functionality is to watch local file changes and synchronize them to multiple remote servers.
This is particularly designed for the scenario when there are **multiple servers in a university lab without a unified system**, and one may want to keep files on all remote servers consistent with local changes, and they can later pick an available server and run the code on it.
Although one may utilize VSCode with SSH extension to develop on a remote server, sometimes it can frequently get disconnected and need a slow reconnection and IDE refreshing, and it does not synchronize changes to multiple server simultaneously.
This toolkit is also intended to include some other shortcuts that may be frequently used, such as synchronizing Tensorboard logs.

Currently we only have an initial implementation and it is under development for optimizing file synchronization and extending functionalities.

## Getting started

The code is based on Python 3. To install it, run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Or run `python setup.py develop` for development.

For major functionalities, run:

```bash
lab CONFIG_FILE_PATH
```

where there needs to be a configuration JSON file at the `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` path.  The path is set to `config.json` by default. The configuration file contains several items where each corresponds to an integrated functionality. To initialize a configuration file with a guide, run:

```bash
lab init
```

## List of Functionalities

See the [configuration format of the functionalities](https://github.com/shizhouxing/labsync/wiki/Configurations).

* `WatchFS`: Watch for changes in the local file system and synchronize them to multiple remote servers.

* `Tensorboard`: Start a Tensorboard server locally.
